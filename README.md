# Retailers-in-COVID
Retailers in COVID is a course project in my fourth semester in R program at LPU. Since COVID-19 brought so much uncertainty in retail traffic, the retailers need to allocate their resources more wisely. To help visualize the impact of COVID-19 on the retail industry, my team built this R-Shiny dashboard utilizing the data from Google Mobility.
